# This branch contains the final code that was submitted for NLP243-HW1



base line model

data - CountVectorizer- tf
no text filterign other than stop words

model - model from section lol

optimizer- adam


SGD -> BAD

batchnorm ->helps a lot


next up: use more drop out, use smaller network -> more regularization
